  <h1>African Crocodile</h1>
  <p>The African crocodile is found in a variety of aquatic habitats throughout sub-Saharan Africa, including rivers, lakes, and swamps. It is a highly adaptable species and can tolerate a wide range of temperatures and environments. However, it prefers shallow, slow-moving waters with plenty of vegetation and basking areas.</p>
  <h2>Behavior</h2>
  <p>The African crocodile is a solitary, territorial species. It is an opportunistic predator that feeds on a wide range of prey, including fish, birds, mammals, and other reptiles. It is a formidable hunter and is capable of dragging large animals into the water to drown them. The African crocodile is also an excellent swimmer and can remain submerged for up to half an hour.</p>
  <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
  <p>The African crocodile is classified as a "vulnerable" species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is threatened by habitat loss, overhunting, and conflict with humans. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the African crocodile and its habitat, including the establishment of protected areas and the regulation of hunting and trade.</p>
